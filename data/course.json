  "course_description": "This class is an applications-oriented course covering the modeling of large-scale systems in decision-making domains and the optimization of such systems using state-of-the-art optimization tools. Application domains include: transportation and logistics planning, pattern classification and image processing, data mining, design of structures, scheduling in large systems, supply-chain management, financial engineering, and telecommunications systems planning. Modeling tools and techniques include linear, network, discrete and nonlinear optimization, heuristic methods, sensitivity and post-optimality analysis, decomposition methods for large-scale systems, and stochastic optimization.\n\nThis course was also taught as part of the {{% resource_link \"73ed91c6-db95-4184-9b33-e63106a9a508\" \"Singapore-MIT Alliance\" %}} (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5223 (System Optimisation: Models and Computation).\n",
